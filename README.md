# Korg-Paper-Rebellion
This is an update to the project listed below. I guess it's not "maybe" anymore, now I'm adding the HTML/CSS portion and filling things in to make it a playable game!

This is a small rock, paper, scissors game that I made while studying on The Odin Project. Currently it only plays within the console but hopefully I'll be able to make it a little more intricate. Maybe add some HTML/CSS? Who knows!
